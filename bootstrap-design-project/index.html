                <h3>State of the Art</h3>
                <p>From our reporting software to our inspection tools, we are equipped with the latest technology to help us find conditions which will affect your investment. We are certified in Infrared Thermography, a technology which allows us to find moisture intrusion and energy inefficiencies that cannot be seen. We also use a high technology drone for chimney and inaccessible roof inspection.</p>

                <h3>We Are Thorough</h3>
                <p>Some inspectors rush from one inspection to the next, often missing critical issues. We take the time to ensure you are fully aware of conditions that affect your investment. We’ll discuss these with you and if you wish, we’ll review the report in detail with you.</p>

                <p>As your inspection company, we have no financial interest in the home sale other than the fee you pay us to conduct the inspection. Maintaining strong, professional relationships with realtors is important for our ongoing business, but at the end of the day we are loyal to you. You can be assured that we will provide honest information about the condition of the home.</p>

We are familiar with building standards and common issues that homeowners should be aware of in each respective area.</p>
